# odin-recipes

Odin recipes is one of my projects since I study and take the course named "The Odin Project."

It gives me a lot of potentials to learn. I enjoy every step that I take, just enjoying the process of learning something new. Commit the journey and all of the efforts and hardworks will payoff, not now, not today but someday it will surely come.
